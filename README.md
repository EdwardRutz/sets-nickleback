# Kill Nickelback

From a nested array of artists and songs, many of which are from Nickleback, create a new array that does not contain songs from Nickleback.



## Instructions

- [X] Define an array that contains arrays. Each array should contain two strings:
    1. The name of an artist
    1. A song by that artist

    Make sure that some of the songs are from the band Nickelback. 
    See [list of their greatest hits](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Nickelback-1/dp/B00FFERTUK/) on Amazon.
    

- [ ] Using array manipulation methods, create a new array that contains all songs that were not performed by Nickelback.
